## dispersion.py - A Python algorithm for phase angle and amplitude correction of pressure bar signals

#### DESCRIPTION:

#### FILES INCLUDED:
- *dispersion.py*: A Python function, with the documentation on the use of the function included in the file as comments. It requires *dispersion_factors.py* to run.
- *dispersion_factors.py*: A Python function, with the documentation on the use of the function included in the file as comments. It requires the folder dispersion_factors.
- 'dispersion_factors' folder: A folder containing pre-calculated values of normalised frequency, normalised velocity and factors m1 and m2 for a material with a Poisson's ratio of 0.29 (i.e. stainless steel). This was calculated using the algorithm *phase_velocity.py* (Van Lerberghe, A., Barr, A. D. (2023)), available on GitHub and ORDA, see links below.
